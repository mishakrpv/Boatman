## API documentation

Documentation is provided by [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and is available at `/swagger`.

<br />

## Running the sample using Docker

You can run the API instance by running these commands from the root folder (where the .sln file is located):

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to make requests to `localhost:5120` for the API project.
